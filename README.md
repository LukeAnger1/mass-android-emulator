So you pretty much need to use the software installed from
https://developer.android.com/studio
the only package I have been using that isnt installable through apt is avdmanager
I have my installation setup for ubtuntu on another branch in development
I want to try and gut this package to only include avdmanager or find a github repo online that has already done this
These python files I have been working on are the main mass android emulator management system.
